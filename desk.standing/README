Standing computer desk - CAD/CAM files to cut on CNC router

This design is an implementation of the Evil Mad Scientists' CNC
Workstation, available at
http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2012/cnc-workstation/

It is a collection of CAD and CAM files to allow you to fabricate your
own desk, including adapting it to your own needs. To do this, you'll 
probably need a CNC router, preferably with a 4'x8' envelope. Or, you
can probably farm it out to a fab shop. 

Have fun!
